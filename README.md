# desire-typer

Desire statement typing in your terminal.

Put your desire statements into files under `~/.statements/` (one statement per non-empty line). For multi-line statements, end the line with `\` to continue on the next line. The app picks one at random and uses it as the typing text.

## Install

**Homebrew** (macOS/Linux):

```
brew tap William-Ger/typer
brew install typer
```

**pip**:

```
pip install typer-cli-tool
```

Then just run:

```
typer
```

## Usage

```
typer              # 30s medium (default)
typer -t 15        # 15 second test
typer -t 60        # 60 second test
typer -d hard      # hard difficulty
typer -t 15 -d easy # quick easy warmup
```
